Any system, you reach or login to, you should check the "/usr/share/cctc/" directory. This is where any/all files of interest or instructions will be provided. You should always check this directory for information, just in case.

When creating tunnels your authorized port ranges to utilize are NSS00 - NSS99
N = NetX (1-8)
SS = Student Number - (ie 01 - 40)
00-99 = available port forward ranges
i.e. Net1_student1 can use 10100 - 10199 and Net4_student14 can use 41400 - 41499
